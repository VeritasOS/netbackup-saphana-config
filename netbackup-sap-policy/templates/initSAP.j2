# backint parameters
#
# policy: is an optionl parameter and should be set to the name of a SAP policy
# type that has been defined in Netbackup.  The SAP policy must have a schedule
# type of Application Backup defined in order for BACKINT to work.  If BACKINT finds
# a $SAP_POLICY environment variable, the policy parameter value will be
# overriden by the value of the $SAP_POLICY variable.  If the policy parameter
# is not specified and there is no environment variable, then BACKINT will
# exit with an error.
